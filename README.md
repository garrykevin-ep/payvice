# Payvice 

This is a open-source expense tracker inspired by splitwise.


### Features
A Group of users going on trip or sharing an apparment have combined expenses. Using payvice expense can be split equally.

1. Create Users using Google oauth
2. Create a Expense Group
3. Add Users to a Expense Group
4. Adding Expense with **multiple payers** and **multiple participants** support

### Todo 
1. Track pay backs

### Setup
This is a gradle multi-project setup.

### Why this Project
This helped me to learn spring boot and improve [domain modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_model).
Splitwise does not have per-item expense seperation.
Example: In shared bill, User A alone bought an item. The item's expense has to go to User A including tax.
Current Solutions does not have per item seperation.
Easy payment integration such as UPI is not available.
